# Professional-Statement
I created STEAM Engineers because of COVID19 shutdowns. Our families were in need of support for their youth while the schools and public resources were shut off to us. I made an agreement with the families who wanted to come over and play videogames with my grandson. If they would allow me to teach them data collection of our community assets i would allow them to play video games. What I learned from the summer of 2019 was that our youth really wanted someone to spend quality time with and our families appreciated the support. STEAM Engineers believe that education starts at home. Supporting the family choices in STEAM careers and lifestyles embraces STEAM Engineers advocacy to help bridge the digital divide. We look to help with wellness and family digital literacy. By having membership based computer labs with fruit/veggie smoothies and herbal tea cafes, offering clinics to help support the family engineering and digital life goals. 


Open Computer Labs  with space to do STEAM clinics that support open source collaborative gatherings is our focus. Families will be able to choose as well as plan and host clinics. Community partners are invited to share resources and support our computer lab. Our families and community members will have access to our computer lab hopefully 24/7 with age restrictions. 

Creating fun family digital lifestyles for our families and community members is another goal. Developing our own video games with youtube and twitch channels helps our families and community open many doors!! We can then host our own tournaments and have our families and communities explore the gaming industry. 

 Acquiring a stable location to convert into STEAM Engineers Computer Lab is the dream!! 

 I'm building my knowledge about cybersecurity with the Grow with Google platform and look to attend CIS university. Helping to build safeguards in our digital lifestyles helps keep threat actors out of our personal and professional business.
