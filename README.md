# Professional-Statement
I'm working to bridge the digital divide in Philadelphia communities by hosting family digital literacy gatherings. We are exploring Open Source digital resources, Video Game development, IT and Cybersecurity for our personal devices. I'm building my knowledge about cybersecurity with the Grow with Google platform and look to attend CIS.
